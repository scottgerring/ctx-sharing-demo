# Contributing

## Pull Request Naming

All pull requests must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Our CI pipeline automatically checks PR titles and will fail if they don't conform to this format. Examples include

- `feat: add span processor for datadog exporter`
- `fix(sampling): correct rate limiting calculation`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
- `docs: add examples for custom span attributes`

## Code Formatting and Linting
Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code passes all formatting and linting checks that run in our CI pipeline. This helps maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

### Third-party Licenses

When adding or updating dependencies, you must update the `LICENSE-3rdparty.csv` file to reflect these changes. This file is checked by our CI pipeline to ensure all dependencies are properly documented.

To update the license file:

1. Run `./scripts/generate-licenses.sh` (requires Docker)
2. Review the changes to `LICENSE-3rdparty.csv`
3. Commit the updated file

The script uses Docker to ensure the generated file matches our CI environment, avoiding platform-specific differences.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required Rust toolchain installed:

```bash
# Install the specific nightly toolchain used for formatting
rustup install nightly-2024-12-16

# Install the minimum supported Rust version
rustup install 1.81.0

# Add required components
rustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly-2024-12-16
rustup component add clippy --toolchain nightly-2024-12-16
rustup component add clippy --toolchain 1.81.0
```

### Running Format Checks Locally

#### Rust Formatting (rustfmt)

Our project uses rustfmt with a custom configuration defined in `rustfmt.toml`.

#### Linting (clippy)

We run clippy with strict settings that treat all warnings as errors. 

### Pre-commit Check

To run all the essential checks before committing:

```bash
# Format code
rustup run nightly-2024-12-16 cargo fmt --all

# Run clippy on minimum supported version (most restrictive)
rustup run 1.81.0 cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Build and test (including doc tests)
cargo build --workspace --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked --doc
cargo test --workspace --locked

# Check license compliance (if you've added/updated dependencies)
./scripts/generate-licenses.sh  # Updates LICENSE-3rdparty.csv
```
